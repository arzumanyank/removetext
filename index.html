            <li><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> Remove Text integrates AdMob advertising to provide ad-supported content. AdMob may collect information for personalized advertising purposes. Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for more information on how AdMob collects and uses data.</li>
            <li><strong>In-App Purchases:</strong> Users have the option to make in-app purchases to access premium features or remove advertisements.

            <li><strong>In-App Purchases:</strong> Information related to in-app purchases is used to process transactions and provide access to premium features or ad-free experiences.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

        <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent users' personal identification information to others. Collected data may be shared with third-party service providers only to the extent necessary to provide the services offered by Remove Text (e.g., ad serving, analytics). These third parties are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>

        <p>We retain collected information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>

        <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable.</p>
